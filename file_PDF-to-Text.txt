1. Introduction
 
1.1 Objective of the Project
 
The main objective of this project is to analyze
 
the Human Resource Management 
(HRM) practices at 
RohTre Media Pvt. Ltd.
 
and propose a conceptual 
Human Resource 
Application (HR App)
 
that can simplify HR operations such as recruitment, attendance, 
payroll, and employee engagement.
 
The proposed app aims t
o bridge the gap between manual HR processes and digital 
transformation by providing a unified, automated, and user
-
friendly platform for both 
HR professionals and employees.
 
1.2 Methodology
 
The study combines both 
primary and secondary research methods
:
 

 
Primary Research:
 
Conducted through a structured questionnaire and direct 
communication with the HR team of RohTre Media Pvt. Ltd.
 

 
Secondary Research:
 
Involved reviewing industry reports and global HR software 
such as 
Workday
, 
SAP SuccessFactors
, 
Oracle 
HCM
, and 
Zoho People
 
to 
understand trends and limitations.
 

 
Comparative Analysis:
 
Evaluated features and performance of existing tools to 
identify improvement areas suitable for SMEs.

)
 

 
Headquarters:
 
Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India
 

 
Industry:
 
Digital Marketing & Creative Media
 

 
Workforce:
 
Approximately 
40
–
60 
employees across marketing, creative, HR, and 
operations teams.
 
Existing 
HR System:
 
The HR operations are primarily managed through 
manual Excel sheets
, 
Google 
Workspace
, and 
email
-
based communication
. Attendance, leave records, and payroll 
data are manually entered each month, making HR processes time
-
consuming and 
prone to hu
man error.
